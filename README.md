# rcs-ocm-deployer

`rcs-ocm-deployer` is an operator designed to deploy `Capp` (ContainerApp) workloads created on the Hub Cluster on the most suitable Managed Cluster using `OCM` (Open Cluster Management) APIs of `Placement` and `ManifestWork`. It also includes a `OCM AddOn` to sync the status of `Capp` between the Managed Clusters and the Hub Cluster.

## RCS

`RCS` (Run Container Service) is an open-source implementation of Container as a Service solution.

It utilizes the `OCM` project to create and manage workloads across multiple clusters, providing cloud-like features and technologies to users running on-premise.

It offers an auto cluster scheduler based on cluster usage and availability, requires basic configuration, and provides an auto-scaler template based on a single metric, among other features.

`RCS` aims to simplify and streamline the management of containerized applications, making it easier for developers to focus on writing code.

## Capp

This operator works together with the `container-app-operator`. For more information about `Capp` and about its API, please check [the Capp repo](https://github.com/dana-team/container-app-operator).

## Open Cluster Management

This project uses the `Placement` and `ManifestWork` APIs of the Open Cluster Management (OCM) project. For more information please refer to the [OCM documentation](https://open-cluster-management.io/concepts/).

## High-level architecture

![image info](./images/rcs-architecture.svg)

1. The client creates the `Capp` CR in a Namespace on the Hub Cluster.

2. The `rcs-ocm-deployer` controller on Hub Cluster watches for `Capp` CRs and reconciles them.

3. The controller chooses the ‘most suitable’ Managed Cluster to deploy the `Capp` workload using the `Placement` API.

4. Each Managed Cluster on the Hub Cluster has a dedicated namespace. The controller creates a `ManifestWork` object on the Hub Cluster in the namespace of the chosen Managed Cluster.

5. The Managed Cluster pulls the `ManifestWork` from the Hub Cluster using the `work agent` and creates a `Capp` CR on the Managed Cluster.

6. A `Capp` controller runs on Managed Cluster, watches for `Capp` CRs and reconciles them.

7. A status is returned from the Managed Cluster to the Hub Cluster using an `OCM AddOn`.

### The controllers

1. `cappPlacement`: The controller adds an annotation containing the chosen Managed Cluster to deploy the `Capp` workload on, in accordance to the `placementDecision` and the desired `Site`.

2. `cappPlacementSync`: The controller controls the lifecycle of the `ManifestWork` CR in the namespace of the chosen Managed Cluster. The `ManifestWork` contains the `Capp` CR as well as all the `Secrets` and `Volumes` referenced in the `Capp` CR, thus making sure that all the `Secrets` and `Volumes` also exist on the Managed Cluster, in the same namespace the `Capp CR` exists in on the Hub Cluster.

3. `addOns`: Refer [here](./addons/README.md) for more information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following should be installed on your Linux machine:

- [`KinD`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [`clusteradm`](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/clusteradm)
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

### Automatic Approach

Simply run the following to get a Hub cluster ready to have `rcs-ocm-deployer` deployed on it, and 2 Managed Cluster with `container-app-operator` already installed on them.

```bash
$ make local-quickstart CAPP_OPERATOR_IMG=ghcr.io/dana-team/rcs-ocm-deployer:<release>
```

### Manuel Approach

#### Setting Up a Hub Cluster and Managed Clusters locally

The [OCM project](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/OCM) contains a script that allows spinning up a `KinD`-based environment, containing of a Hub Cluster and 2 Managed Clusters.

##### The script

You can clone the repository and set up the environment. This script would create 3 clusters with the following Kubernetes contexts:

- `kind-hub`
- `kind-cluster1`
- `kind-cluster2`

To switch between contexts, use:

```bash
 $ kubectl config use-context <CONTEXT_NAME>
```

Run the script:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/OCM
$ bash ./OCM/solutions/setup-dev-environment/local-up.sh
```

#### Create ManagedClusterSet

`ManagedClusterSet` is an [OCM cluster-scoped API](https://open-cluster-management.io/concepts/managedclusterset/) in the Hub Cluster for grouping a few managed clusters into a "set".

To create a `ManagedClusterSet`, run the following command on the Hub Cluster:

```bash
$ clusteradm create clusterset <clusterSet-name>
```

To add a Managed Cluster to the `ManagedClusterSet`, run the following command on the Hub Cluster:

```bash
$ clusteradm clusterset set <clusterSet-name> --clusters <cluster-name>
```

To bind the cluster set to a namespace, run the following command on the Hub Cluster:

```bash
$ clusteradm clusterset bind <clusterSet-name> --namespace <clusterSet-namespace>
```

#### Create Placement

For the controller to work, it is needed to create a `Placement` CR. The `Placement` name then needs to be referenced in the [environment variables of the controller manager](#environment-variables).

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: <placement-name>
  namespace: <clusterSet-namespace>
spec:
  clusterSets:
    - <clusterSet-name>
```

#### Install the Capp CRD

The `Capp` CRD needs to be installed on the Hub Cluster:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dana-team/container-app-operator
$ cd container-app-operator
$ make install
```

#### Install cert-manager

To use `rcs-ocm-deployer`, you need to have `cert-manager` installed on your cluster. Follow the [instruction here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).

#### Deploying the controller

```bash
$ make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/dana-team/rcs-ocm-deployer:<release>
```

#### Configuration Using RCSConfig CRD

The `rcs-ocm-deployer` operator utilizes the `RCSConfig` CRD to manage its configuration and deployment options.

An instance of the `RCSConfig` CRD named `rcs-config` should exist in the `rcs-deployer-system` namespace. This CRD instance contains the necessary configuration for the operator.

```bash
apiVersion: rcsd.dana.io/v1alpha1
kind: RCSConfig
metadata:
  name: rcs-config
  namespace: rcs-deployer-system
spec:
  placements:
  - placement-1st
  - placement-2nd
  # Add more placement names as needed
  placementsNamespace: your-placements-namespace
```

Ensure that the spec section includes a list of `placements` and specifies the `placementsNamespace` as required for your setup.

- Note: In previos releases, there were environment variables for the `placements` and `placementsNamespace`. However, please note that these environment variables have been deprecated and are no longer used.

### Deploy the add-on

Follow the [instructions here](./addons/README.md). Note that the `AddOn` and the controller use the same image.

#### Build your own image

```bash
$ make docker-build docker-push IMG=<registry>/rcs-ocm-deployer:<tag>
```

### Capp example

```yaml
apiVersion: rcs.dana.io/v1alpha1
kind: Capp
metadata:
  name: capp-sample
  namespace: capp-sample
spec:
  configurationSpec:
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - env:
              - name: APP_NAME
                value: capp-env-var
            image: 'quay.io/danateamorg/example-python-app:v1-flask'
            name: capp-sample
  routeSpec:
    hostname: capp.dev
    tlsEnabled: true
    tlsSecret: cappTlsSecretName
  logSpec:
    type: elastic
    host: 10.11.12.13
    index: main
    username: elastic
    passwordSecretName: es-elastic-user
    sslVerify: false
  scaleMetric: cpu
```
